| [BVCU Thermal Catalog App](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/6855626/bvcu_thermal_catalog_app)                           | An App that calculates the clear field (Uo) and linear transmittance (psi) values for foundation, floor, parapet corner and window/doors for Brick Veneer Concrete Block Unit (BVCU) wall systems for any value of exterior insulation. These values are needed to thermal bridging calculations to comply with the National Energy Code for Buildings (NECB). |
| [BVWS Thermal Catalog App](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/1652032/bvws_thermal_catalog_app)                           | An App that calculates the clear field Uo and linear transmittance values for foundation, floor, parapet corner and window/doors for Brick Veneer Concrete Block Unit (BVCU) wall systems for any value of exterior insulation. These values are needed to thermal bridging calculations to comply with the National Energy Code for Buildings (NECB).         |
| [BVSS Thermal Catalog App](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/6727343/bvss_thermal_catalog_app)                           | An App that calculates the clear field Uo and linear transmittance values for foundation, floor, parapet corner and window/doors for Brick Veneer Steel Stud (BVSS) wall systems for any value of exterior insulation. These values are needed to thermal bridging calculations to comply with the National Energy Code for Buildings (NECB).                  |
| [Thermal Bridging Assembly Calculation](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/7431858/thermal_bridging_assembly_calculation) | An App based on the BC hydro/Fortis/Powersmart “Enhanced Thermal Performance Spreadsheet”. The app calculates the impact on the clear field of a wall elevation from the thermal bridging effects of linear transmittances (foundation, floor, roof, corner, window/doors) and point transmittances (signage, etc.)                                            |
