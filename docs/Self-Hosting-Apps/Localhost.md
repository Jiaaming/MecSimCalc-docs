# Self hosting on localhost

This tutorial will guide you on how to download your app and run it locally on your own computer at this url: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

:::caution
This is an advanced tutorial and prior experience using the terminal is expected
:::

## Downloading the code

1. Go to https://github.com/MecSim/MecSimCalc-self-hosted and download the source code
   You can either:

   1.1 Click on **Code** > **Download ZIP** on the Github site, and then extract the ZIP file

- 1.2 Or execute the `git clone` command in your terminal (if you have `git` installed)

```
git clone https://github.com/MecSim/MecSimCalc-self-hosted
```

## Setting up the back-end server

1. [Download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you do not have it installed
2. Open your terminal, and `cd` into the `back-end` folder

```
cd MecSimCalc-self-hosted/back-end/
```

3. Install all Python packages in `requirements.txt`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the server

```
python server.py
```

:::tip
If `python server.py` does not work, try `python3 server.py`
:::

5. You should see the following printed to your terminal

```
* Serving Flask app 'server' (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
  WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
  Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Debug mode: on
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
* Restarting with stat
* Debugger is active!
* Debugger PIN: 742-486-046
```

## Setting up the front-end client

1. [Download node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you do not have it installed
2. Keep the server process running from before and open another terminal
3. `cd` into the `front-end` folder

```
cd MecSimCalc-self-hosted/front-end/
```

4. Install all the npm packages in `package.json`

```
npm install
```

5. Start the development server

```
npm run dev
```

6. Your website should now live at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), you can open it in your web browser. The following should be printed to your terminal:

```
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info  - Loaded env from \MecSimCalc-self-hosted\front-end\.env
```

3. Refresh the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and voil√†, your apps should now show up

## Production build

When your self-hosted application is ready to be deployed into production, make the following changes

1. In `server.py`, set `debug` to `False`:

```
server.run(debug=False)
```

2. In `.env`, change `NEXT_PUBLIC_API` to the url of your Python server, if needed
3. Start the front-end server in production mode:

```
npm run build
npm run start
```
