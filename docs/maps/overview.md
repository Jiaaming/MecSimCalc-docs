# Overview

**MecSimCalc** supports the displaying of maps and makes working with geospatial data easy.
Two Python libraries used for displaying maps are [GeoPandas](#geopandas) and [Folium](#folium).

:::note
**Interactive** map means the _**user**_ can interact with the map through dragging, zooming, panning, hovering, and clicking actions.
**Static** map means the map is an image that can not be interacted with.

## GeoPandas

> [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/) makes working with geospatial data in Python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed by [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io). GeoPandas further depends on [fiona](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/) for file access and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting.

GeoPandas should be used when you have a lot of data, have data structured as a table, or need to manipulate geospatial data. GeoPanda's `GeoDataFrame` is an extension of Panda's `DataFrame`, making it easy to manipulate large amounts of geospatial data.

Once the geospatial data to be visualized is stored as a `GeoDataFrame`, it can easily be exported as an interactive map using Folium, or as a static plot using Matplotlib.

:::tip
All of the methods for Panda's [`DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) can similarly be applied to GeoPanda's [`GeoDataFrame`](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.html).
You can think of `GeoDataFrame` as a Panda's `DataFrame` with added functionality for geospatial data.

## Folium

> Folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the Leaflet.js library. Folium makes it easy to visualize data thatâ€™s been manipulated in Python on an interactive Leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.

Folium is an interactive mapping library that exports a map that the user can drag, zoom, pan, click, and hover on. It also allows the drawing of simple shapes, such as lines, markers, and circles.
Folium lacks the data manipulation of GeoPanda's `GeoDataFrame`, and therefore, should only be used independently when visualizing very few data points.

It is possible to prepare your data as a `GeoDataFrame`, and then export it as a Folium map.

See Folium documentation [here](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/).
For a detailed example, see [example 3](example-3).
