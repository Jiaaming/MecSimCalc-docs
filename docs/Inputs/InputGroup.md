# Input Group

In order to visually organize the inputs, **MecsimCalc** platform allows the _**developer**_ to visually group any set of inputs into either an `Input Group` or a [`Table Group`](TableGroup.md). An `Input Group` can be created in the **Inputs** step by clicking on `Add Input Group`.

:::tip

The different input types appear in the menu only if an `Input Group` or a `Table Group` has already been created.

:::

The _**developer**_ can create as many new `Input Groups` as needed which are arranged vertically on top of each other. Each `Input Group` can be renamed, deleted, or dragged to change its vertical position relative to other `Input Groups`. For example, the image below displays two `Input Groups` that the developer has named: `Input Group 1` and `Input Group 2`.

# Layout of an Input Group

The _**developer**_ can add as many inputs as needed within an `Input Group`. The inputs can be resized and moved within the input group using the mouse. A maximum of 10 inputs can appear on the same row in an `Input Group`. The _**developer**_ can add as many inputs and there is no restriction on the number of rows to be used within an `Input Group`. The height of the `Input Group` will automatically adjust as more inputs are added, removed, or dragged. As an example, The figure below shows an input group with 5 different inputs (two numerical inputs, two text inputs, and one single select input).
