# CSV Files and Tables

## Exporting Tables

There are different ways by which a table can be embedded in the output page. [Example 3](../getting-started/example-3) in the introduction section provides a detailed example that the _**developer**_ can follow in which a table is generated and embedded in the output page. The example provides two options. In the first, the `<table>` HTML tag is used while the `.to_html()` method in the `pandas` python library is used in the second.

The `<table>` HTML tag can also be used to generate a table directly in the output editor as shown in the [Conditionals](../output/Conditionals#for-statement) section.
