## How apps work

1. **Input**: the value for `input_0` is inputted by the user.
2. **Code**: the user input is accessed in the code using `inputs['input_0']`. Calculations are executed using the popular Python language, and computed outputs are returned.
3. **Output**: the three outputs returned from _Code_ are embedded in rich text using `{{outputs.Metre}}`, `{{outputs.Feet}}`, and `{{outputs.Inches}}`.
